# CustomerDataUploader
Original requirements:
1. Build a .NET web app where a user can upload the data file
2. Send ALL the data in the file to the API
3. Check the data to make sure it is uploaded
4. Show the user the results of the upload
5. Store the data in a Database Table (please use either SQLite or MSSQL)
6. Store the status of the upload and the hash received from the API in the database
7. Provide a page to search for records that have been uploaded and view the result
8. Upload your code to a git repository (github / bitbucket)

Due to time constraints, omitted DB interaction and testing...
